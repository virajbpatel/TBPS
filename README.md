# Data Pipeline
1. Load simulated datasets from `/data`.
2. Apply initial filtering by doing hard cuts by doing Manual filtering/ hard cuts. This will be done on all the datasets, including the simulated acceptance.
3. Train Machine Learning model(s) on the partially filtered datasets
4. Classify and filter the `total_dataset` and `acceptance_mc` based on predictions from the model
5. Off to Fitting group!
